# III. Sample Notebooks and Notes Setup

## Overview
I have updated the `Coursemate_data.json` file to include sample notebooks for all your courses with example notes demonstrating the template system.

## Courses Added
1. **GEN 001: Purposive Communication**
2. **GEN 002: Understanding the Self**
3. **GEN 006: Ethics**
4. **PED 030: Physical Education**
5. **MAT 152: Mathematics in the Modern World**
6. **ITE 260: Computer Programming I Python**
7. **ITE 366: Introduction to Computing**
8. **NSTP: Civic Welfare Training Service I**

## Templates Demonstrated
Each course includes at least 2 sample notes using different default templates:

- **Main Idea & Details**: Used for structured content breakdown
- **5W1H**: Used for comprehensive topic analysis
- **Modified Frayer Model**: Used for concept definition and understanding
- **Polya's 4 Steps**: Used for problem-solving approaches
- **Concept Map**: Used for showing relationships between ideas

## Custom Template Added
**Weekly Planning Template**: A practical template for organizing weekly goals, tasks, and reflections.

Example usage in "Personal Growth Plan" (GEN 002) and "Exercise Planning" (PED 030).

## Template Applicability Demonstration
- **Technical Courses** (ITE 260, ITE 366, MAT 152): Use Polya's 4 Steps for problem-solving, Concept Maps for system understanding
- **Non-Technical Courses** (GEN 001, GEN 002, GEN 006): Use Main Idea & Details for content organization, 5W1H for comprehensive analysis
- **All Courses**: Modified Frayer Model works for any concept learning, Weekly Planning for time management

## Sample Notes Content
Each note contains realistic, course-appropriate content that demonstrates:
- Template structure usage
- Academic relevance
- Practical application
- Study aid effectiveness

## For Mock Defense Preparation
When demonstrating:
1. Show how templates guide note-taking
2. Explain how different courses benefit from different templates
3. Demonstrate custom template creation
4. Show notebook organization across subjects
5. Highlight the flexibility for both technical and non-technical learning

This setup provides comprehensive examples showing that CourseMate accommodates diverse learning needs across all your courses.
